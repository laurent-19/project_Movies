## Project Movie App

### Description
This project used Dart and Flutter for a basic movie app which combines UI and API elements.

### Dependencies

This app was designed using various dependecies:

```dart
build_runner
freezed
redux
```

, which enabled us to generate the needed classes/Models rapidly.


It is based on concepts like **containers**, **presentation** and **middleware**, everything being divided into categories, 
following the rules of a standard **Redux** *state management* approach.
